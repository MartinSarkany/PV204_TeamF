Project JPasswords JPWS
CHANGELOG 

Reference JVM version: 1.6.0
Available language versions: English, German, Spanish
Database format: PWS-V3.13

*** Release V 0-7-1 ***, 26 Mar. 2016

CORRECTED BUGS
- PortableInstallationDialog allows to integrate the current JRE into a PORTABLE installation
  (this feature was announced for 0-7-0 but effectively unavailable)
- Colour contrast in Table View is now automatically adjusted to always render legible lines

NEW FEATURES
- overhauled and simplified PortableInstallationDialog 
- PortableInstallationDialog now supplies all types of program files even when run from
  a Windows EXE program version (boosts cross-platform feature)
- PreferencesDialog allows to set up reference to the email client application used
  to start mail writing
- Extended multi-threaded approach for "File" menu commands; several tasks can run parallel
- Some info and operation dialogs which were modal before are now in non-modal (parallel) mode
- Behaviour of Password History panel has been slightly modified as to the effects of the
  "Off/On" switch

INTERNALS
- ActionHandler was overhauled to run thread pools for many of the program's tasks.
  It now offers support for immediate, delayed and periodic task initiation.
- Menu commands via ActionHandler now run by default on the EDT instead in a separate
  thread. In contrast, file loading and saving commands regularly run in dedicated tasks.
- Parallel processing for "Close-All" and "Save-All" commands when multiple files are
  open in the desktop.
- New technology implemented for record editor. Commands now mostly run on the EDT.  


*** Release V 0-7-0 ***, 24 Dec. 2015

CORRECTED BUGS
- the possibility of re-opening a very recently closed database without input of 
  secret key has been removed

NEW FEATURES
- FTP file access was modernised by making it rely on package ftp4j.jar (Sauron Software).
  Overall operation time has largely improved. A new login dialog is supplied.
- it is now possible to create database files via FTP access. This facility has to be
  enabled in Preferences, by default it is switched off.
- storage of minor changes, like file usage recording data, is now stored and retrieved 
  locally when program option "store minor file changes into database" is disabled in
  program preferences. Thus it is possible to keep track of usage data without having to
  save the database.
- shortcut keys have been introduced and allow to open particular entries into the entry 
  editor upon key-hit. Assignment of keys to records is performed in the entry editor.
  Policies on short-key usage in JPasswords is more precisesly explained in the Wiki Manual
  on our Sourceforge project site.
- the Password Policy (random password creation rules) is now differentiated on 3 levels:
  Global (in Preferences), File (in "Manage" menu) and Record (in entry editor). File and
  Record levels take reference to a predecessor's content by default, but can be overridden
  by individual settings.
- buttons and logic of the Quick-Search panel (CTRL-Q) have been overhauled and extended
  by a "remove expression" function.
- the "Portable Installation" service (under "Help" menu) has been enhanced. It now allows 
  to include the running JRE into an installation. The complete logic of this service will
  be supplied in the Wiki Manual pages.
- acceleration keys in the main menu have been amplified
- ENTER (edit), INSERT (new) and DELETE (remove) are now meaningful standard keys in the 
  entry list display.

INTERNALS
- FTP service module ftp4j.jar was added to the project and is bundled with the jpws 
  executable. ftp4j appears by Sauron Software, Italy, under the LGPL 2 license.


*** Release V 0-6-0 M7 ***, 01 Mar. 2013

CORRECTED BUGS
- removed a bug that made popup-menu command "tear off notes" inactive in editor.notes field
- improved text display in preferences dialog
- removed a glitch with identifying the "program path" attribute in some environments which call
  the application through a symbolic link instead of a direct reference.

NEW FEATURES
- Editor: Password Policy in generation of additional random password (button "Additional Password")
  is now the record's own policy if available. 
- re-installation of mirrors for new (unsaved) databases improved (re-installs now as "New File" 
  without tagging the container as mirror or backup)  
- new Preferences feature to select from various date and time rendering formats 
- added paging functionality to the Quick-Search panel. You can return to previous search 
  expressions by arrow buttons. 
- updated "File Info" panel. It now shows user name, host and application of most recent
  saving session. "Signature" has been replaced by a serial version number x of the file
  indicated by "(SV x)" after the file name.    

INTERNALS
- IOManager: implemented wait cycles in case of IO access conflicts (5 seconds retry time)
- security update for the encryption/decryption process. With thorough memory testing
  some spreading of decrypted content garbage onto the VM data heap have been removed. 
  JPasswords VM memory should now be clean from decrypted database content except for 
  Title, User-Name and those data parts which have been made visible by the user.
- cryptographical random generator now runs on SHA512 instead of SHA1.   
- JPWS relies on updated PWSLIB version 2-3-1.   


*** Release V 0-6-0 RC3 ***, 17 Nov. 2012

CORRECTED BUGS
- some errors concerning Undo/Redo of modifications to Password Policy in the entry editor
- improved stability of Undo/Redo for external file imports (backups)
- removed an error which occasionally produced meaningless "PROJECT NEWS" messages
- removed an error which possibly spoiled display after returning of the program from IDLE or ICONIFIED state
- some corrections and improvements concerning database recovery and mirroring
- removed an error which disabled user defined display fonts  

NEW FEATURES
- possibility to define own special characters (modifications to set "symbols") in password policies (compatibility to file format 3.10)
- calls to Help dialogs (normally a button) are now toggle functions which show and hide the dialog depending on its showing state
- improved IO-logic to addressing files which are open and modified in the JPWS Desktop
- call of an external email client in entry editor via button or context command in text fields
- restructured call of external browser to start OS standard browser if user option
  for browser is left void (Preferences)
- removed offering of automatically detected browser applications during program startup
  (moved this offering to a button in Preferences instead)
- added cooperation of JPasswords with the Operating System Icon Tray, supplying a program icon
  (this feature is working for Windows OS; Linux environments, and their JVM systems, mighty be less ready to work error free. We recommend to use the Tray Icon feature only after thorough testing!)  
- the system tray icon offers invisibility of the program while iconified plus some
  basic operations like adding new records and calling most recently used ones
- the system tray icon brings up the program's surface from invisibility when double-clicked (activated)   
- commandline option "/o" now allows to specify a directory or a file. If a directory is given, INI-files of both Unix and Windows flavour are being searched there. Non-existing structures from the "/o" path are created.
- added function button in entry editor to generate additional random passwords
- added basic print ability to text areas via context menu, like e.g. for entry "Notes"
- overhauled Locale support and new command-line parameter "/c:<country>" for user setting of locale country 
- support of the SPANISH GUI language "es" (with exception of most html texts)
- improved extraction from NOTES text area into context menu list via right-click: contained URLs to browse and MAIL addresses to write to
- text field context commands COPY, CUT, DELETE are now acting as if "all" was selected if nothing is selected    
- more accurate memory of individual GUI states when changing hosts in PORTABLE modus (frame, browser, fonts, and some security switches)

INTERNALS
- File format is now compatible with PWS Format 3.10 (Project "Password Safe"). Implications for the following features:
  o modified Password Policy storage
  o List of Recently Used Entries is now stored following the format definition
- overhauled dialog and message system (exclusively project-own structures used)
- removed the PORTABLE modus option history and switched to host-borne usage states (Java VM Preferences mechanism)
- overhaul of display event handling chain results in speeded list display with improved security


*** Release V 0-6-0 RC2, 05 May 2012 ***

Modifications against RC1
-------------------------

Bugfix::
- drag & drop functional in java-6
- Nimbus LAF operational
- improved stability of list display and trans-session memory

New Features::
- new outfit for file access password setup
- password generation optional during file access password setup
- file mirroring extended to new files without path
- free floating additional command bar in entry editor
- blindfolding of list display after selectable time
- optional automatic copy of password after starting to browse an URL
- text editor shortcut keys for current date and time input
- updated user help texts
- updated auto-install browser application paths
- EMAIL, INTERVAL und POLICY new columns in csv-export/import format

- - - - - - - - - - - - -
KNOWN ISSUES:

1 - For automated function "Create Portable Installation" any one or both of files "jpws.jar", "jpws-s.jar" have to be present in the program directory of JPasswords.
2 - There is a probability of dead-locking the application during definition of the password for a new database when using the "Generate" button and when run under SUN JVM. In any case of dead-lock, and if you have work to save, it is recommended to wait for 2 minutes before terminating the program by force as the auto-mirror thread normally still works fine. 


*** Release V 0-6-0 RC1, 10 Feb. 2010 ***

CORRECTED BUGS
- removed a bug that caused failing program termination under Mac-OS
  (request 1265649)

  (targeted to comprise all possible modification types)
- UNDO manager in entry-editor to comprise: revert command, password generation, GROUP
  assignment, expiry assignment, password history settings
- UNDO manager for text components in entry editor (usable through CRTL-Z, CTRL-Y
  or popup menu in NOTES)
- PORTABLE modus of program execution, detected automatically when INI file is present
  in program directory; may also be forced with commandline option "/p"

  With every save operation a time-marked backup file is saved; a submenu in "Files" allows
  user to revert to any listed backup file version
- new commandline options "/p" for forced PORTABLE modus and "/n" for forced NORMAL modus
  (both are exclusive to each other with /n owning priority). If /p combines with /o:<file>
  it forces the directory of <file> to become the PORTABLE ROOT
- improved random data pool collection (well, it was good before, but why not make it better?)
