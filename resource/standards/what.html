<h3>What is JPasswords?</h3>

<i>JPasswords</i> is a password management program with encrypted databases. It allows you to store passwords or passphrases, together with related management data like <u>username, entry title, dates and notes</u>, on encrypted disk files. Access to such a file is protected by a single <u>secret key</u> that you can define and change at any time. The currently used database format is deemed by experts as one of the most secure you can find anywhere. <i>JPasswords</i> allows you to set different security levels to hamper password guessing attacks by time delay.</p>
<p>Password entries may be ordered within groups (which can be nested) and displayed in tree or in table view. Upon retrieval of a password, the program assists you with a <u>"copy to clipboard"</u> function to make password or username quickly available for other applications. Several useful service functions, like <u>file copy, automatic backup and restore, concurrent data mirroring</u>, but also <u>secure file erase</u>, elaborate <u>undo/redo</u> and a versatile <u>portable modus</u> make this program a pleasure to use and a singular event in the market.</p>
<p>Format and encryption method for database files are compatible with "<i>Password Safe</i>" V3 files from the open source project of same name. </p>
