The <b>Database Editor</b> allows you to choose a security level for your password database and enter some secondary information. Name and description for the database are not required to operate the file but are there for your convenience only. All text entered in this dialog is stored encrypted. Settings of this dialog show in the <i>File Information</i> panel and may be modified there at any later time.

<table cellpadding="6">

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Database Name</font></b></td>
<td><i>Text</i> up to 128 characters length. The name entered here will show in the program title and in some dialog panels in place of the file path. This happens only if the corresponding option has been checked in program preferences.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Description</font></b></td>
<td><i>Text</i> up to 256 characters length. This text is only for your personal notes, e.g. concerning the purpose of a database. 
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Security Level</font></b></td>
<td><i>Choice</i>. This setting should be considered carefully. There are four security levels you can choose from; all of them are concerning the delay time coming into effect when a database is opened with its security key. The delay time is noted in calculation "loops". Calculation loops are a not circumventible part of the algorithm required to open the database. The more loops you set up for a file, the safer it is against dictionary and brute force attacks (but the longer it takes to open the file for operations).

<p>In <b><i>JPasswords</i></b> you can change the security setting of a database at any later time. The setting is available in the <i>File Information</i> panel.

<p>The recommended default setting is <b>"ADVANCED"</b>.
