<H3><font color="#005FBF">General</font></H3>

With the <b>URL File Link</b> facility you can open a password database which is located on a remote resource that can be reached via HTTP or FTP protocol on the Internet. HTTP loaded files can only be read but not written. FTP loaded files can also be written when modified; new files can be created via FTP when this function is allowed in program security preferences. For file creation state a file's unknown path in this dialog. FTP with SSL is currently not possible. 

<H3><font color="#005FBF">Security Considerations</font></H3>

In general, posting any security-sensitive data on publicly accessible resources is a severe hazard. Even the best encryption used does not change this simple rule. This facility has been made available for people who think they desperately need it or who might use a private network they deem secure enough. 

<P>In case you decide to post a password database on an Internet resource, you should make sure to set up the best possible security settings for this file. In my conviction, the access password (secret key) should be random generated and have a length of at least 12 characters. In any case dictionary words must be avoided!

The editable choice field <b><font color="red">URL</font></b> accepts valid URL notations. Furthermore the field memorises up to 8 successful orders if option "<b>use recent file list</b>" is activated in program preferences.

<P>The <b><font color="red">Clear</font></b> button removes all entries from the URL choice list. 

<H3><font color="#005FBF">Operation</font></H3>

The <b><font color="red">OK</font></b> button will start operation and close this dialog. Depending on your Internet connection, it may take a few seconds until a response is shown. (You can observe the working status by the small wheel sign on the lower right corner of the program window.)

<P>If you entered an FTP address, the next response is likely to be a login request from the FTP site. Enter username and password in the dialog panel. For your convenience, <i><b>JPasswords</b></i> remembers FTP logins during a single program session.

<P>After a connection to the file has been established, the password request is shown and the database can be loaded into the workshelf.
