<H3><font color="#005FBF">General</font></H3>

CSV Export creates text output of your password entries formatted by one of two possible format patterns, named <b>"DATABASE"</b> or <b>"SPREADSHEET"</b>. Independently thereof, a variety of character sets can be chosen from to encode text according to the needs of your working environment.

<table cellpadding="6">

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Source File</font></b></td>
<td>Database in the work shelf.
<P>Displays the database from which to export. 
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Scope</font></b></td>
<td>"<b><small>ENTIRE FILE</small></b>" or "<b><small>RECORD SELECTION (x)</small></b>".
<P>Indicates whether export encompasses all records of the file or a user selection. In case of a user selection, the amount of selected records is shown.

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Text Format</font></b></td>
<td>Options: <b><small>DATABASE</small></b> and <b><small>SPREADSHEET</small></b>. 
<P><I>JPasswords</I> implements RFC-4180 for outputs of the "<U><B><small>DATABASE<small></B></U>" type, which is the foundation of IANA registered <B>MIME type "text/csv"</B>. This format is advisable to store the full content of the database without modifications. Time values are stored as "epoch" seconds (integer).

<P><I>JPasswords</I> implements a shortened content variation with format type "<U><B><small>SPREADSHEET</small></B></U>" to meet some requirements of calculation table applications. Use this output to view your file as a spreadsheet. These are the differences: i) some less relevant data fields are omitted (including UUID), ii) separator character is semicolon instead of comma, iii) time values are shown as readable text, and iv) line feeds within datafields are translated into blanks. 
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top"><b><font color="red">Character Set</font></b></td>
<td>Options: List of available character sets of your Java Virtual Machine. 
<P>Choose the most suitable standard matching the environment where you are going to use the output. "<U><B>UTF-8</B></U>" is a general good choice for all languages and environments. Users of the Western hemisphere might alternatively wish to choose "<U><B>ISO-8859-1</B></U>" or "<U><B>windows-1252</B></U>".

<H3><font color="#005FBF">About CSV</font></H3>

CSV is often read as "comma separated values" and is a widely and loosely used text format to transport and even operationally store databases which are built on a record or table structure. Despite its popularity, there is no prescriptive standard defined for this format or any of the content data types. In consequence problems can arise when attempting to import CSV files into other applications. 

<H3><font color="#005FBF">Security Considerations</font></H3>

CSV output makes your passwords visible in cleartext and hence is ditrimental to the purpose of <i>JPasswords</i> to keep your passwords protected. Try to avoid making copies of your output file because every copy, even after it is "deleted" by your file manager, continues to constitute a security threat for you. Erase output files and any copies as soon as possible with the "<B>Secure File Wipe</B>" utility which is offered in <i>JPasswords'</i> Help menu. However, with modern SSD-drives this is quite pointless and you are left with modifying your passwords!
