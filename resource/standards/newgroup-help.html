<H2><font color="#8B0000">Create New Group or Sub-Group</font></H2>

In <i>JPasswords</i> new groups are created by editing field GROUP for a database entry. Sub-groups are separated from their ancestors by a dot, so for example "<b>Internet.Provider.Abroad</b>" for a nested sub-group "<b>Abroad</b>" under "<b>Provider</b>" under "<b>Internet</b>". Groups have no independent nature and exist only as long as they are noted in at least one of the entries.

<p>You can edit a group value directly in the entry editor or for a set of selected entries over function "Move to Group", available through a right-click. - Try it out! The "Undo"-function lets easily correct any mistakes.
